# Mati - React Native Mobile App

Welcome to the starting point for your Mati mobile app! This project will be built with React Native and Expo, which makes developing for both iOS and Android a smooth process.

## Getting Started (One-Time Setup)

This folder is currently a placeholder. To create the actual mobile app project, you will need to run a single command in your terminal.

1.  **Navigate to this directory** in your terminal. Make sure you are inside the `mobile` folder.

2.  **Run the following command:**

    ```bash
    npx create-expo-app .
    ```

    *   This command uses `npx` (which comes with Node.js) to run the `create-expo-app` tool.
    *   The `.` at the end tells it to create the project in the current directory (`mobile`).
    *   It will ask you a few questions. You can choose the "Blank" template when prompted.

## What's Next?

Once you have successfully run the command above, the project will be created. Let me know when you're done, and from there I can help you:

*   Build the login and sign-up screens.
*   Connect the mobile app to our existing Firebase backend.
*   Start creating the dashboard and other features.
*   Share logic between the web and mobile apps for consistency.

I'm ready when you are!
